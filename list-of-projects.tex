\section*{Journal submission for MTT}

Longer exposition of MTT paper submitted to LICS. Hopefully also containing the nicer canonicity
theorem and some of the other examples we had in the technical report. Should also mention our new
strictification theorem.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Journal
\end{description}

\section*{Simply-typed MTT}

Take MTT, remove dependent types. Explain the result to a structural proof theorist: split into
natural deduction and sequent calculus, prove a cut elimination theorem, etc.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Journal
\item[Status] Ongoing work, sequent calculus portion remains unfinished.
\end{description}

\emph{Note, AIML is biannual, so it's not until 2022. This means this will be a journal submission.}

\section*{Gluing for dual-context modal calculi}

Prove normalization for Alex's dual-context presentation of some calculi via gluing. Generalizes the
previous work by also seamlessly handling commuting conversions.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Conference
\item[Status] Rough notes sketched, main theorem to be proven.
\end{description}


\section*{The syntax and semantics of Fitch-style type theories}

A rationalization of the Fitch-style type theory as well a demonstration that it subsumes many
interesting modal and non-modal type theories in use today. Potentially also some gluing arguments
showing that we can prove a lot of nice metatheorems in a straightforward way.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Journal
\item[External collaborators] Evan Cavallo, Adrien Guatto.
\item[Status] Rough notes sketched, some key theorems are only conjectured.
\end{description}

\section*{MTT and choreographies}

Marry together MTT and higher-order coreographies, the resulting theory would then be compiled to
$\pi$-calculus and shown to be deadlock free.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Conference
\item[External collaborators] Andrew Hirsch, Deepak Garg, Hannah Gommerstadt.
\item[Status] Ongoing work, goal of completing in July.
\end{description}

\section*{Warps}

Use our understanding of the Fitch-style type theory to construct a programming language for guarded
recursion with warps. Potentially interested in constructing a program logic or compilation strategy
for the resultant language.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Conference
\item[External collaborators] Adrien Guatto.
\item[Status] Ongoing work, goal of completing in July.
\end{description}

\section*{Authorization logic}

Use our modal logics to improve on existing authorizaton logics. This would require some survey
work, but hopefully beyond this we can just use simply-typed MTT.

\begin{description}
\item[Type] Conference.
\item[External collaborators] Andrew Hirsch.
\item[Status] Not yet started.
\end{description}
