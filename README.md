## secret notes

The secrecy is marginal at best.

 - `right-adjoint-to-diagonal.tex`

 A simple and self-contained proof that the right adjoint to the diagonal is the limit functor.

 - `subobject.tex`

 An explicit construction of the subobject classifier in a glued topos.

 - `maps-into-quotients-of-colimits.tex`

 A proof that all monomorphism `PSH(C)` are generated by pushouts, retracts, and transfinite
 compositions of subobjects of quotients of representables.

 - `accessibility-topoi-and-gluing.tex`

 Random facts about accessible categories (such as raising the index of accessibility) and a proof
 that the glued category is accessible if the functor is itself accessible.

 - `invertibility-hypothesis-for-sset.tex`

 A proof of the invertibility hypothesis for simplicial categories (an instance of coherence by
 cofibrant replacement!).

 - `product-of-topoi.tex`

 A construction of the product of Grothendieck topoi as well as the corresponding tensor product on
 locally presentable categories.
